# My Application

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

To build the Angular 2 Loopback SDK, make sure this backend project and the angular frontend project are named as `frontend` and `backend` or the `npm build:sdk` command won't work.

```
parent-dir/
  frontend/
    <angular2 part>
    src/
      admin/
      public/
      shared/
        sdk/
  backend/
    <loopback part>
    common/
    server/
```

You can also symlink the `frontend/dist` folder to `client-symlink` in this project and then configure your `server/config.development.json` to set the `client/` directory to your newly symlinked dir.
